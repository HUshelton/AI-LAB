- Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the projects, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive projects)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HUshelton/AI-LAB.git
   cd AI-LAB
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
